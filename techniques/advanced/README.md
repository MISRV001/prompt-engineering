## üîó Chain-of-Thought Prompting

### Basic Technique
Ask AI to show its reasoning step-by-step.

```
Instead of: "Solve this math problem: 47 √ó 23"
Use: "Solve this step-by-step, showing your work: 47 √ó 23"
```

### Advanced Applications

#### Complex Problem Solving
```
Analyze this business challenge using step-by-step reasoning:

Challenge: Customer churn rate increased 15% last quarter
Available data: [list your data]

Think through this systematically:
1. First, identify potential root causes
2. Then, evaluate each cause based on available data
3. Next, prioritize causes by impact and likelihood
4. Finally, recommend specific actions with expected outcomes

Show your reasoning for each step.
```

#### Code Debugging
```
Debug this code by thinking through the logic step-by-step:

[paste problematic code]

Walk through:
1. What the code is supposed to do
2. What it's actually doing (trace execution)
3. Where the logic breaks down
4. Why this causes the observed error
5. How to fix it with minimal changes
```

---

## üéì Few-Shot Learning

### Progressive Examples
Provide examples that increase in complexity.

```
Here are examples of professional email responses:

Simple inquiry:
Q: "What are your business hours?"
A: "Hi! We're open Monday-Friday 9AM-5PM EST. Happy to help anytime during those hours."

Complex request:
Q: "Can you customize your software for our unique workflow?"
A: "Thanks for your interest! Yes, we offer customization services. I'd love to learn more about your specific workflow needs. Could we schedule a 30-minute call this week to discuss your requirements and explore how we can help?"

Complaint handling:
Q: "Your service was down for 2 hours yesterday!"
A: "I sincerely apologize for the service interruption you experienced. You're absolutely right to be frustrated. We had an unexpected server issue that has now been resolved with additional safeguards. I'd like to credit your account for the downtime and ensure this doesn't happen again. May I have your account details to process this immediately?"

Now respond to: [your specific email]
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Prompt Chaining

### Multi-Step Complex Tasks
Break large tasks into connected smaller prompts.

#### Content Creation Pipeline
```
Step 1: "Generate 10 blog post ideas about sustainable living"
Step 2: "Create detailed outline for: [selected idea from step 1]"
Step 3: "Write introduction section using this outline: [from step 2]"
Step 4: "Continue with main content sections..."
```

#### Analysis Pipeline
```
Step 1: "Summarize key themes in this customer feedback: [data]"
Step 2: "Prioritize these themes by business impact: [from step 1]"
Step 3: "Create action plan for top 3 priorities: [from step 2]"
```

---

## üé≠ Role-Based Prompting

### Expertise Simulation
Have AI adopt specific professional perspectives.

```
Act as a [specific role] with [years] of experience in [domain].

Context: [your situation]
Challenge: [what you need help with]

Respond as this expert would:
- Use industry-specific knowledge and terminology
- Reference relevant best practices and standards
- Consider practical constraints and trade-offs
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Mention potential risks or considerations
```

#### Examples:

**Senior Marketing Manager**
```
Act as a Senior Marketing Manager with 10 years of B2B SaaS experience.

Context: We're launching a new project management tool for remote teams
Challenge: Need to differentiate from established competitors like Asana and Trello

Provide a go-to-market strategy that a seasoned marketing professional would recommend.
```

**Lead DevOps Engineer**
```
Act as a Lead DevOps Engineer with 8 years of experience in cloud infrastructure.

Context: Our startup is growing rapidly and our current deployment process is manual
Challenge: Design a CI/CD pipeline that scales with our team growth

Recommend a solution considering our limited DevOps budget and small team.
```

## üß† Meta-Prompting

### Self-Improving Prompts
Ask AI to improve its own prompts or approach.

```
Before answering my question, first:
1. Analyze what I'm really asking for
2. Identify what additional context would be helpful
3. Suggest a better way to phrase this request
4. Then provide your best answer

My question: [your original question]
```

### Prompt Optimization
```
I want to use AI to help with [task]. Here's my current prompt:

"[your current prompt]"

Please:
1. Identify weaknesses in this prompt
2. Suggest improvements for clarity and specificity
3. Provide an optimized version
4. Explain why the changes will work better
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraint-Based Prompting

### Structured Output Control
Use constraints to get exactly the format you need.

#### Format Constraints
```
Provide your analysis in exactly this format:

**Problem**: [One sentence problem statement]
**Impact**: [Quantified business impact]
**Root Cause**: [Primary cause identified]
**Solution**: [Recommended action]
**Timeline**: [Implementation timeframe]
**Success Metric**: [How to measure success]

Do not deviate from this structure.
```

#### Content Constraints
```
Write a product description following these exact requirements:
- Exactly 150 words (not 149, not 151)
- Include 3 specific benefits
- Use active voice only
- Include one customer pain point
- End with a clear call-to-action
- Use conversational but professional tone
```

---

## üéØ Combination Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought + Few-Shot
```
Here are examples of how I analyze competitor pricing step-by-step:

Example 1: [detailed step-by-step analysis]
Example 2: [another detailed analysis]

Now analyze this competitor using the same systematic approach:
[competitor information]

Show your step-by-step reasoning like in the examples.
```

### Role + Constraint
```
Act as a technical writer creating API documentation.

Write documentation for this endpoint following these constraints:
- Maximum 200 words
- Include: description, parameters, example request/response
- Use exactly these section headers: Purpose, Parameters, Example, Notes
- Write for developers with 2+ years experience

[API endpoint details]
```

---

## üîÑ Iterative Refinement

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Start with a basic version, then improve:

Prompt 1: "Write a marketing email"
Prompt 2: "Make it more persuasive and add urgency"
Prompt 3: "Adjust tone for B2B audience"
Prompt 4: "Add personalization placeholders"
```

### A/B Testing Prompts
```
Create two different versions of [content type]:

Version A: [specific approach/tone/style]
Version B: [different approach/tone/style]

For each version, explain:
- Target audience fit
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Expected performance
- When to use this version
```

---

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Token Efficiency
```
Efficient: "List 5 Python debugging techniques"
vs
Verbose: "I would really appreciate it if you could please provide me with a comprehensive list containing exactly five different techniques that can be used for debugging Python programming language code"
```

### Context Management
```
For long conversations:
"Summary of our discussion: [key points]
Building on this, now help me with: [new request]"
```

---

## üé™ Creative Techniques

### Perspective Shifting
```
Analyze this problem from 3 different viewpoints:
1. As a customer experiencing the issue
2. As a business owner concerned about costs
3. As a developer implementing solutions

For each perspective, explain the priorities and concerns.
```

### Analogical Reasoning
```
Explain [complex concept] by comparing it to [familiar concept].

Then extend the analogy to help me understand:
- How the systems are similar
- Where the analogy breaks down
- What this teaches us about the original concept
```
