### 🔍 Modern Stack Debugging Examples

#### NextJS 14 SSR Hydration Issues
```
Debug this NextJS 14 hydration mismatch error:

Error: "Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server"

```typescript
// app/dashboard/page.tsx
'use client';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Dashboard() {
  const [userCount, setUserCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setUserCount(Math.random() * 100);
  }, []);
  
  return <div>Users online: {userCount}</div>;
}
```

Context:
- Happens only in production build
- Works fine in development
- User sees flash of incorrect content
- App Router with both server and client components
- Using middleware for authentication

Analyze the hydration issue and provide solutions for:
1. Fixing the immediate error
2. Preventing future hydration mismatches
3. Best practices for dynamic content in SSR
4. Alternative patterns for client-side only data
```

#### TypeScript Performance & Memory Issues
```
Debug TypeScript compilation performance degradation:

Issue: TypeScript compilation taking 45+ seconds, previously took 5 seconds

Project details:

- React + NextJS 14 with App Router
- Multiple workspace packages
- Complex type definitions with conditional types
- Generic utility types heavily used

Recent changes:
- Added GraphQL code generation
- Introduced new component library
- Updated from TS 4.9 to 5.2

Error patterns:
- tsc shows high memory usage (8GB+)
- IDE becomes unresponsive during type checking
- Build times increased 900%

Analyze and provide solutions for:
1. TypeScript compiler optimization
2. tsconfig.json tuning for large projects
3. Type definition refactoring strategies
4. Incremental compilation setup
5. Memory usage optimization
6. Alternative build strategies
```

#### Node.js BFF Memory Leaks & Performance
```
Debug Node.js BFF service experiencing memory leaks:

Symptoms:
- Memory usage grows from 200MB to 2GB over 4 hours
- Response times degrade from 50ms to 2000ms
- Eventually crashes with "JavaScript heap out of memory"
- CPU usage spikes to 100% before crash

```typescript
// Suspect code area
class DataAggregator {
  private cache = new Map<string, any>();
  private subscribers = new Set<WebSocket>();
  
  async aggregateData(userId: string) {
    const cacheKey = `user:${userId}:${Date.now()}`;
    
    if (!this.cache.has(cacheKey)) {
      const data = await this.fetchUserData(userId);
      this.cache.set(cacheKey, data);
    }
    
    return this.cache.get(cacheKey);
  }
  
  subscribeToUpdates(ws: WebSocket) {
    this.subscribers.add(ws);
    ws.on('close', () => {
      // WebSocket cleanup
    });
  }
}
```

Environment:
- Node.js 18.17.0 with TypeScript

5. Monitoring and alerting setup
6. Load testing recommendations
```

#### React Performance with Large Lists
```
Debug React component rendering performance issues:

Problem: DataTable component with 10,000+ rows causing browser freeze

```typescript
interface DataTableProps {
  data: User[];
  onSort: (column: string) => void;
  onFilter: (filters: FilterState) => void;
}

const DataTable: React.FC<DataTableProps> = ({ data, onSort, onFilter }) => {
  const [sortState, setSortState] = useState<SortState>({});
  const [filterState, setFilterState] = useState<FilterState>({});
  
  // Re-renders on every prop change
  const filteredData = data.filter(item => 
    Object.entries(filterState).every(([key, value]) => 
      item[key as keyof User]?.toString().includes(value)
    )
  );
  
  const sortedData = filteredData.sort((a, b) => {
    // Complex sorting logic
  });
  
  return (
    <table>
      {sortedData.map(item => (
        <TableRow key={item.id} data={item} />
      ))}
    </table>
  );
};
```

## 🔍 Code Review & Optimization

### Code Review Template
```
Please review this [language] code for:
- Best practices and conventions
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance improvements
- Readability and maintainability
- Error handling
- Edge cases

[Paste code]

Context: [brief description of what the code does]
```

### Optimization Examples

#### Algorithm Optimization
```
Review and optimize this sorting algorithm:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Please suggest:
1. Time/space complexity improvements
2. More efficient algorithms for this use case
3. Python-specific optimizations
4. When to use built-in sort vs custom implementation
```

#### Database Query Optimization
```
This query is slow on large tables. Please optimize:

```sql
SELECT u.name, u.email, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.email
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 5
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

Table info:
- users: 1M+ records, indexed on id and created_at
- orders: 5M+ records, indexed on id and user_id
- Query currently takes 30+ seconds

Suggest indexing strategies and query improvements.
